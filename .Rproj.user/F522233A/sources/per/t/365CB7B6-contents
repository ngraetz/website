summary: _**Revise and Resubmit.**_ While evidence suggests a durable association between redlining and population health, we lack an empirical account of how this historical act of racialized violence produced contemporary inequities. In this paper, we use a mediation framework to evaluate how redlining grades influenced later life expectancy and the degree to which contemporary racialized disparities in life expectancy between Black working-class neighborhoods and white professional-class neighborhoods can be explained by past HOLC mapping. Life expectancy gaps between differently graded tracts are driven by urban renewal, economic isolation, and property valuation that developed within these areas in subsequent decades. Still, only a small fraction of the total disparity between contemporary Black and white neighborhoods is predicted by HOLC grades. We discuss the role of these maps in analyses of structural racism, positioning them as only one feature of the larger public-private project of conflating race with financial risk. Policy implications include targeting resources to formerly redlined neighborhoods, but also dismantling broader racist logics of capital accumulation codified in more abstracted political economies of place.
