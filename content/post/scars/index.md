subtitle: _**In Progress**_
summary: _**In Progress.**_ The sociopolitical environments where immigrants in the U.S. live have changed drastically in recent decades, with substantial variation across and within states. Yet there is limited empirical investigation of the consequences of these changes for population health. Linking panel data from the Health and Retirement Study (2004-2016) to data on county-level immigration enforcement and state-level immigrant policy, this study estimates three-way fixed effects models to examine how within county changes in immigration enforcement and within state changes in immigrant policy shape within person changes in health. We pay particular attention to racial-ethnic and nativity variation in these links. Results show that as local immigration enforcement intensifies and state policy contexts become more restrictive, foreign-born adults—especially Latinx immigrants—experience accelerated health decline, including increases in functional limitations and physiological dysregulation. Like episodes of physical violence that can leave lacerations and damage—both visible and more hidden—our results provide evidence of the health harms of state sanctioned legal violence - what we call scars of legal violence. Findings highlight how policies governing immigrants not only shape structures of racial domination and immigrant exclusion but the embodied health inequities that flow from them, with implications for understanding and redressing population health disparities.
