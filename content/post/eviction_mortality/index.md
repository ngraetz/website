subtitle: _**In Progress**_
summary: _**In Progress.**_ We construct a novel longitudinal dataset linking all renters in the 2000 Census to 38 million eviction court records (2000-2016) and administrative death records from the Census Numident file (2000-2019). For the subsample of renters who also completed an American Community Survey between 2008-2012, we link data on rent burdens to measure within-individual changes since 2000. Conditional on geographic and renter-level covariates, a 50% rent burden in 2000 was associated with X% (X-X%) higher mortality from 2000-2019 compared to a 30% burden. Following renters over time, 10 and 20 percentage point increases in burden (2000 to 2008-2012) were associated with X% (X-X%) and X% (X-X%) higher mortality from 2008-2012 to 2019. Evictions were heavily concentrated among low-income Black renters from 2000-2016, especially women aged 30-50. Across all renters, the threat of eviction (a court filing without a judgement) was associated with a X% (X-X%) increase in mortality and an eviction judgement was associated with a X% (X-X%) increase. We examined heterogeneity in these associations by age, race, gender, and predicted risk of eviction. We discuss implications for health and housing policy during the COVID-19 pandemic while contextualizing these debates within the broader, durable ecology of housing insecurity and death that was entrenched long before the pandemic.
