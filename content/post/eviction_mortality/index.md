subtitle: _**Under Review**_
summary: _**Under Review.**_ We construct a novel longitudinal dataset linking all renters in the 2000 Census to -- million eviction court records (2000-2016) and administrative death records from the Census Numident file (2000-2019). For the subsample of renters who completed an American Community Survey between 2008-2012, we also measure within-individual changes in rent burden since 2000. Conditional on renter, household, neighborhood, and state characteristics, we show that a 50% rent burden in 2000 was associated with --% higher age-adjusted mortality from 2000-2019 compared to a 30% burden. Following those persistently renting during midlife from 2000 to 2008-2012, 10 and 20 percentage point increases in burden were associated with --% and --% higher mortality from 2008-2012 to 2019. Across all renters, the threat of eviction (a court filing without a judgement) and an eviction judgement were associated with --% and --% higher mortality. We examined variation in these associations by age, race, gender, state of filing, and modelled eviction risk. We discuss implications for health and housing policy during the COVID-19 pandemic while contextualizing these debates within the broader, durable ecology of housing insecurity and death that was entrenched long before the present crisis.
