subtitle: _**In Progress**_
summary: _**In Progress.**_ In contrast to common individualized determinants of health such as income and education, the political economy of housing is an understudied but fundamental cause of premature death in the United States. Within the private rental market, where the majority of low-income adults must turn for housing, eviction is a traumatizing and prevalent event that likely widens health and mortality disparities between renters and owners â€“ though this has been difficult to study given data limitations. We describe a novel administrative linkage project connecting formal eviction records to all-cause mortality data from the Census Numident file, resulting in xx.x million linked records from 2000-2016. We estimate cumulative mortality risk by race, gender, cohort, and poverty status, demonstrating significant disparities within these groups between homeowners vs. renters. The cumulative risk of eviction is highest for Black renters as they age from 30-50, especially for low-income Black women (xx-xx%). We estimate the effects of an eviction on all-cause mortality, finding acute and chronic impacts across the life course conditional on a large set of baseline renter characteristics. Last, we link an additional xxx,xxx eviction records for a subset of cities in 2020-2021, demonstrating that mortality increased exponentially within the evicted population during this phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss implications for housing policy during the pandemic, while also contextualizing these debates within the broader, durable ecology of eviction and mortality that has been entrenched for decades.
