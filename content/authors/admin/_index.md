My interdisciplinary quantitative research is organized around two central tenets of sociology: context and explanation. Contemporary contexts and outcomes are the function of cumulative, historical exposures. I use relational sociology to inform quantitative analyses of place, race, and class, focusing on the entangled, reciprocal systems of social and economic reproduction. My dissertation work uses causal mediation analysis to answer relational questions about the role of place in producing racialized inequality across the life-course, including the long-run consequences of racist housing policies on outcomes related to household wealth and individual health. My research is driven by a commitment to applying theory-driven quantitative methods to real-world problems in a way that is transparent, reproducible, and motivated by a need to address the fundamental causes of social and health inequity in the United States. 

My academic work in these areas is published or forthcoming in the _Journal of Health and Social Behavior_, _Nature_, _Spatial Demography_, _Sociological Methodology_, the _Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences_, the _New England Journal of Medicine_, and elsewhere.
