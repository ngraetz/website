I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University where I lead a collaboration between Princeton’s Eviction Lab and the U.S. Census Bureau. I hold a joint PhD in demography and sociology from the University of Pennsylvania (2021). I work at the intersection of urban sociology, political economy, and population health. I’m also an active member of the Climate and Community Project, a progressive climate policy think tank developing research on the climate and inequality nexus. This work includes collaborations with housing and labor organizers, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, and the Environmental Protection Agency. I’m interested in communicating sociological perspectives to external audiences and building coalitions across academics, policymakers, journalists, and the public.

My interdisciplinary quantitative research is organized around two central tenets of sociology: context and explanation. Contemporary contexts and outcomes are the function of cumulative, historical exposures. I use relational sociology to inform quantitative analyses of place, race, and class, focusing on the entangled, reciprocal systems of social and economic reproduction. My research is driven by a commitment to applying theory-driven quantitative methods to real-world problems in a way that is transparent, reproducible, and motivated by a need to address the fundamental causes of social and health inequity in the United States. 

At Princeton’s Eviction Lab, I'm working on several projects related to the rental housing market, displacement, social programs, and health outcomes. Many of these projects are in close collaboration with the Census Bureau, where we are linking individual eviction records to restricted-use data on welfare enrollment, employment, and mortality. This work situates racialized housing inequality as a fundamental cause of population health disparities, focusing on profiteering, exploitation, and power relations between specific actors (e.g., landlords and tenants). This project has produced three papers currently under review. I'm currently in the process of extending this work through two new projects. The first examines how rent prices have evolved over time for different income groups, focusing on the different ways in which landlords exercise market power. The second examines how housing market actors (e.g, banks, insurers, investors) are redistributing climate-related financial risk to vulnerable groups, especially tenants. 

I'm also working on a set of simulation and data fusion methods for creating robust small-area estimates in the United States, combining ACS data with other national surveys such as the Residential Energy Consumption Survey. This includes funded collaborations with Data for Progress, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, and the EPA. I co-authored several policy briefs using this work for the Data for Progress Green New Deal platform, Senator Nikil Saval’s COVID-19 platform, and Congressman Jamaal Bowman’s Green New Deal for Schools platform. 

My academic work in these areas is published or forthcoming in the _Journal of Health and Social Behavior_, _Social Forces_, _Nature_, _Spatial Demography_, _Sociological Methodology_, the _Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences_, the _New England Journal of Medicine_, and elsewhere.
