I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University where I lead a collaboration between Princeton’s Eviction Lab and the U.S. Census Bureau. I hold a joint PhD in demography and sociology from the University of Pennsylvania (2021). I work at the intersection of population health, urban sociology, and political economy.

My primary research focus has been revealing the mechanisms through which the housing market entrenches racial inequalities in health. While it’s well known that structural inequalities shape population health, I’ve developed new data and tools to isolate and quantify specifically how factors like redlining, eviction, and housing costs create cumulative disadvantage—and the ways in which different actors profit from these arrangements. Throughout all my work, I use relational sociology to inform analyses of place, race, and class, aligning cutting-edge quantitative methods with careful attention to historical scholarship and causal inference debates. My academic work in these areas is published or forthcoming in _Social Forces_, the _Journal of Health and Social Behavior_, _Nature_, _Spatial Demography_, _Sociological Methodology_, the _Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences_, the _New England Journal of Medicine_, and elsewhere.

I’m also an active member of the Climate and Community Project, a progressive climate policy think tank developing research on the climate and inequality nexus. This work includes collaborations with housing and labor organizers, policymakers, and federal agencies. I’m interested in communicating sociological perspectives to external audiences and building coalitions across academics, policymakers, journalists, and the public.
